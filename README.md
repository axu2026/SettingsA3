# Assignment 3: Settings Screen
This app is for assignment 3 of CS 501 E1, creating a mock settings screen using Material 3 components, modifiers, and Rows and Columns for layout. This settings page does not actually apply settings, but it does save options in the composable's state.

A Column is used as the main layout with each setting being its own Row. Each row has a label, support text, and a controller from M3. Modifier.weight() is used to space out these controls, and there are several other M3 components with their respective modifiers to build the layout.

## AI Disclosure
ChatGPT was used several times to assist with debugging, such as fixing issues with setting up modifiers, spacing for components, state hoisting, importing, and implementing the Snackbar composable.
